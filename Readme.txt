This file contains explanations concerning the data and the programs used to 
obtain the results presented in the paper "An interaction point process for 
Bayesian inference of the composition of multiple water source from 
hydrochemical data" by C. Reype, R.S. Stoica, A. Richard, M. Deaconu.

The software and data files in this package are free for use and modification 
for public research and public academic activities only. This software is 
continously under development, and although we have done our best to ensure 
that the programs work correctly, we can not guarantee that they are bug free. 
So the responsibility for the results and conclusions obtained by using this
software falls to the user.

The archive contains the following directories:

C++/SRC : C++ source code of the programs.
C++/DATA : data files used in the paper (synthetic, Mexico, Athabasca datasets).
C++/EXEC : contains the batch files that demonstrate how to run the programs. 
C++/PARAMS : parameter files for the executable programs.
C++/RESULTS : results files used in the paper.
R : R code for the preparation and the presentation of the data. 

1. DATA
The data files used can be found in the directory C++/DATA. This directory contains the synthetic data set,
the Mexico data set and the Athabasca data set.

2. PROGRAMS
	The program sources are in the directory C++/SRC. The programs that we 
have written to implement our model are built using the standard C++ object 
oriented programming language. The programs are derived from DRLib, two C++ 
library. The DRLib is used to modeling, simulation and inference of marked
point processes and is developped at Institut Elie Cartan de Lorraine by D. Gemmerl√©,
 R.S. Stoica, C. Reype and N. Gillot. The associated documentation is available at
https://gitlab.univ-lorraine.fr/labos/iecl/drlib.

We have written no extra documentation For the present programs.  But the 
programs themselves are written in explicit style, giving clear names 
to the variables and including many comments. The user can compile the 
programs using the provided Makefile. 

	The directory C++/EXEC contains the batch files showing how the 
C++ programs have to be used. 

	The directory C++/PARAMS contains the parameter files needed by the 
programs, and referred to in the batch files of the EXEC directory.

	The directory R contains a script, "plot_Hug.R", which can be used to 
plot the results. It also includes an executable, "Hug_application.bat",
which can be used to normalise the data, create the region of interest, 
creates the parameters file and plotting the results. To work properly, 
the folder "Rshiny.7z" must be extracted into this directory.

	The user has to check that the path to the data file is correct.
